Hi there! 👋 I'm Oleksii. I work as a full-time software engineer. In my spare time I do open-sourcing _(normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning before the work)_.

Most of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing -  **to help people learn** 📚. You may use these projects to learn about _algorithms in JavaScript_ and get prepared for _technical interviews_, or to learn _Python_ syntax and start experimenting with _machine learning algorithms_ and math behind them, etc.
