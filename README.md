Hi there! 👋 I'm Oleksii. I work as a full-time software engineer. In my spare time I do open-sourcing _(normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning before the work)_.

Most of my open-source projects are focused on one thing -  **to help people learn**. You use these projects to learn about _algorithms in JavaScript_ and get prepared for _technical interviews_ better, or to learn _Python_ syntax and start experimenting with _machine learning algorithms_ and math behind them, etc.

## What I've done so far

- 📝 [trekhleb/javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) - algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript with explanations and links to further readings.
- 🐍 [trekhleb/learn-python](https://github.com/trekhleb/learn-python) - playground and cheatsheet for learning Python. Collection of Python scripts that are split by topics and contain code examples with explanations.
- 🤖 [trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning](https://github.com/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning) - Python examples of popular machine learning algorithms with interactive Jupyter demos and math being explained.
- 🤖 [trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments) -  Interactive Machine Learning experiments: models training + models demo.
- 🤖 [trekhleb/nano-neuron](https://github.com/trekhleb/nano-neuron) - NanoNeuron is 7 simple JavaScript functions that will give you a feeling of how machines can actually "learn".
- and [+8 more](https://github.com/trekhleb?tab=repositories).
